Check DUT1 Global Routing table
    use device "${DUT1}"
    ${response}=  run "show ip route summary | grep /"
    log  ${response}
    log  ${global_route}
    Set suite variable  ${global_route}  ${response}
Compare to DUT2 Global Routing table
    use device "${DUT1}"
    ${response}=  run "show ip route summary | grep /"
    #Should Be Equal As Strings  ${response}  ${global_route}
    Should contain  ${response}  ${global_route}
